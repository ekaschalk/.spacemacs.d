# List of module names for which member attributes should not be checked
# (useful for modules/projects where namespaces are manipulated during runtime
# and thus existing member attributes cannot be deduced by static analysis. It
# supports qualified module names, as well as Unix pattern matching.

[DESIGN]

# We are capable to follow that many, yes!
max-branches = 20

# some base class constructors have quite a few arguments
max-args = 14

# and due to ClassWithCollections and conditional attributes classes by default have lots
# of attributes
max-attributes = 14

# some sci computation can't be handled efficiently without having
# lots of locals
max-locals = 35
